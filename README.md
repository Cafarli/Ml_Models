Within each folder, you will find Python scripts implementing different machine learning models. These scripts are designed for various tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and more. Each script is accompanied by a brief description of its purpose and the type of machine learning model it implements.

In addition to the Python scripts, this repository also includes datasets sourced from Kaggle. These datasets are used by the machine learning models for training and evaluation.
